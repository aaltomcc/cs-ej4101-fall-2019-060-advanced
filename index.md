PS, since Hugo wasn't working, and it is a known issue that happens sometimes, I decided to do the starter project instead. This is because it was impossible for me to debug travis when hugo compiled only a blank site. So here is, an AMAZING starter project site!

## About
Hi guys and gals :)

My name is Sindre, and I am a half Norwegian half Finnish student at Aalto! I like beautiful web pages and the food in Dipoli. I am not a fan of Hugo bugging out and not starting up on my local computer. Otherwise I enjoy making web pages, and have found Webflow especially to have the best UI editor out there! I highly recommend you check it out, even though the integrations aren't as plentiful as with Wordpress just yet
