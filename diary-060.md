# this course
I decided to take this course to learn the big picture (and fundamentals) of DevOps. 
What are the most important parts of it, and what it looks like in practice.

I also wanted to learn how to do Continuous Integration and Deployment in practice.
The credit also didn't hurt, but mostly I was interesting in what this really means.
And how I could do my own projects better, especially those where we are many. 
Usually school projects often having 2-8 team members.

# learned
* The fundamental philosophy behind Dev Ops, and what it means for how to work in technological projects.
* One of my new favourite words, namely Kaizen. The process of continually getting better, daily, step by step.
* I definitely improved my markdown skills.
* How to easily set up Github Pages to have a url to share different projects I'm working on.
* Learned that Github Services are Deprecated, and how easy it is to set up Actions. This lead me to set up automatic testing for both a Flask backend and a React frontend app for a course project.
Both of which where basically 3 clicks in Github Actions! Yuuuuuge ROI for our small project.
These automatically happen with every Pull Request! 
* The most challenging part of the course was fighting with Hugo, and debugging Travis. They might both be a bit overkill for the purpose of this course. Also Github Services is already deprecated, and Actions are SO much nicer!! They really are magic!
* The most enjoyable part of the course was working directly with Github Pages with markdown! (Also in general it pushed me to start using Github Actions in other projects)
